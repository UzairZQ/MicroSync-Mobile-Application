Daily Call Reporting: Sales representatives can submit daily reports on their calls with doctors and other healthcare professionals, including details such as the name of the healthcare provider, the products discussed, and any feedback received.

Medicine Orders: Sales representatives can place orders for medicines and other products directly from the app, ensuring they have the supplies they need to meet their sales targets.

Weekly Call Planning: Sales representatives can plan their weekly calls in advance, setting reminders for upcoming appointments and ensuring they stay on track to meet their sales targets.

# Technologies Used
